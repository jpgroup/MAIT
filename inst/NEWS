04â€“10-14  First MAIT release.

Package Description: Current tools for Liquid Chromatography and Mass
    Spectrometry (LC/MS) for metabolomic data cover a limited number
    of processing steps, whereas online tools are hard to use in a
    programmable fashion. This paper introduces the Metabolite
    Automatic Identification Toolkit (MAIT) package, which makes it
    possible for users to perform metabolomic end-to-end LC/MS data
    analysis. MAIT is focused on improving the peak annotation stage
    and provides essential tools to validate statistical analysis
    results. MAIT generates output files with the statistical results,
    peak annotation and metabolite identification.
